# Bootstrap Portfolio

## Description

This project involves building a personal portfolio layout using the Bootstrap CSS Framework. The motivation behind this project is to gain hands-on experience with HTML, CSS, GitHub, GitHub Pages, and Bootstrap. It goes beyond being a homework assignment, serving as a practical application of the skills acquired in web development.

The portfolio addresses the need for a professional and responsive layout that showcases projects, skills, and personal information. Through this project, I learned how to leverage Bootstrap to create a visually appealing and accessible web design.
